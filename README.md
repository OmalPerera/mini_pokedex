## Get started with tech
This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project.

_Due to time constraints, the nature of the requirements, and development compatibility, I decided to proceed with the Exp project._

Follow the steps to run the app
1. clone the repo and navigate into the project
2. Install the dependencies : `npm install`
3. Start the app: `npx expo start`

## Testing the app
- unit test done for utility functions using jest. use `npm test` to run jest tests
- ES-Lint and Prettier have been set up with rules to ensure code quality.


#### Some final thoughts:

- This API (https://graphql.pokeapi.co/v1beta2) has a rate limit of 200 requests/h. So I focused on caching, pre-loading, and persisting details for each PokÃ©mon, and slightly increased the number of items per page to reduce server calls.
- There is still much room for reach perfection, but Iâ€™m limited by the time. :)
